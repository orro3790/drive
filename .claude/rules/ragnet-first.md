# RAGNet-First Rule

Before any coding, refactoring, or planning task that involves an external library or service:

1. Query RAGNet for relevant external documentation and patterns.
2. Only use web search if RAGNet does not have the needed guidance.
3. Cite the RAGNet sources used when describing the approach.
4. If the user specifically states the task involves only internal code, do not use Ragnet.

This rule applies to Claude and OpenCode agents.
